5 Elements Theory

5 Elements
- are fundamental of creation and security
- Increase/Decrease in elements wil lead to issues
- Thanmai
	- padaithal, kaathal, alithal
- Body made up of 5 elements
	- Changes/imbalances in these elements will cause disease
	- If 5 Elmnts are balanced, body will remain healthy

GOD
- Generator, Operator, Destroyer


Why wood is first?
- Since it is spread across the globe in a minute energy particle
- Source of energy

Taste
- Taste should be diluted in mouth and should go in as tastelessness
- If went inside with taste, it stores in organ and becomes weak result as disease


Case Study:
Case#1

Patient with below Characteristics:
- Bypass Surgery at 32 yrs
- After 10 yrs went for siddha and took motion tablets to clean colon
- Resulted with excess decentry and ate curd rice that lead to gas formation in entire body
- It started weaking him as not able to walk or climb steps for long distance and not able to lift anything heavier and not feeling active and sluggish

Root Cause
- As 30-40, earth element period and hence it can heal all the problems comes on that period if we strengthen it.
- Sine it is not strengthened, the blood vessels carrying blood to heart or blood flow to heart disturbance would be cleared.
- The weakness in earth element, led to indigestion or fat that blocked blood vessels to heart.
- Since he is 42 age now and it is age of metal hence, which will reflect all the symptoms of chest heavines, breathlessness, breathing problem when walking, running, gas formation in stomach, decentry, motion sickness, cold or sinus etc will come.
- Lu9 blood vessel influential point, blood influential point ub17, chest distal p6, local ren17, pschylogical effect du20, ex1
- General Health
	- st36, li11, du14

Case#2
- Patient Hunger, motion, urine normal
- Current Age 28
- Weight 86 kgs
- Sleep comes late one day 12 other day 2am or later
- Inhealer used everyday twice and it is started since 4 yrs
- if he don't inheal, He can't sleep  or can't start day
- High hairfall, vericose vein below right knee
- Ashtma, Veezhing
- At the age of 23, Operated for kidney stones 
- At age of 10, took tablet for one year as penis didn't developed as per age. Hormonal injection is given

Analysis
- Blood Vessels are related to metal element
- Vericose vein comes when the capacity of blood vessels shrink and expand is reduced or not able to shrink. Also, related to lungs weakness where the breathing capacity is low due to inhealer usage
- If there is problem with lungs, then the disease force will be stagnant in connecting tissues or its son kidney which then kidney stone has come up and reflects issue in sense organ
- Stomach/Spleen issue is accumulated in lungs and goes out like gas
- As lungs nature is dryness, it dries out kidney and as a result it formed stones
- Chronic constipation, cold will create stones in kidney
- If hormonal injection is given which will collaps liver/gall bladder who is the head for tissues, muscles and body shrink or excess weight gain. If collapsed, it can't control the muscle and hence body grows like anything
- If weight gained due to endocirne problem, there is no use of doing diet or excercise or fasting or anything to reduce weight

- Cure
- Since pt has veezing at age 4 and it is period of wood element.
- As per counteract cycle, wood affected metal hence water didn't get strength from metal to boost fire.
- As wood is impacted, it couldn't share energy with fire and hence fire couldn't control earth.
- Root cause is wood
- As age is 28, it is minor fire age then need to strengthen SI, H so to do this give H9, SI3 by checking if Liver/Galbladder is strong or not.
- If not, use backshu & frontmu alarm points
- If symptom is acute, use backshu or chronic use frontmu points
- Use Liv14 frontmu for liver, Gb24, 21 for GB frontmu alarm points
- Breathig issue Ren17, Lu1, Lu6 for acute symptom
